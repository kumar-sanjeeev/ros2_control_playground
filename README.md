# *ros2-control-playground*
Welcome to the **ros2 control framework playground** repository! This repository serves as a demonstration of how to effectively utilize the ROS 2 control library to simulate the visual representation of a robot defined in URDF format within the Gazebo Physics simulator. This resource is especially valuable for those interested in leveraging the pre-existing control algorithms provided by ROS 2 control.

## Overview

This repository offers an interactive environment for exploring ROS 2 control framework capabilities. By using the provided code and resources, you can:

- Simulate the visual representation of a robot defined in URDF format.
- Integrate this simulation with the powerful Gazebo Physics simulator.
- Learn how to apply and experiment with ROS 2 control algorithms on your simulated robot.
